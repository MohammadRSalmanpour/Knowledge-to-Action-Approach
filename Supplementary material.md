Ninety-six generated statements and their sources (interviews and literature searches). A total of 36 stakeholders were recruited, including end-users (e.g., physicians and frontline clinicians), clinical AI researchers, implementation experts, digital health strategists, and health system leaders. Participants were purposefully selected to ensure diversity in expertise, sector representation, and demographics, enabling a comprehensive perspective on integrating AI into clinical diagnostic workflows. Recruitment was conducted via snowball sampling and community-based outreach, targeting individuals with experience in healthcare delivery, clinical workflow operations, or AI system development. The resulting statements informed participant brainstorming, selection, and the development of study goals and preparatory activities.
