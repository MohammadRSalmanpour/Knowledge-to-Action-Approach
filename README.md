Bridging the Gap: Using Concept Mapping to Enhance AI Implementation in Medical Diagnosis: A Knowledge-to-Action Approach
Enabling Digital Twins and AI Solutions through Implementation Science
A Stakeholder-Informed Concept Mapping and Knowledge-to-Action Framework for AI in Diagnostic Decision Support

#Project-Overview

This repository contains the data, analysis scripts, and visual outputs from our study on barriers to implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Digital Twins (DTs) in clinical diagnostic decision support.

Using Concept Mapping (CM) within the Knowledge-to-Action (KTA) framework, we engaged diverse stakeholders (clinicians, AI developers, health leaders, and implementation experts) to identify and structure 96 implementation barrier statements into 11 thematic clusters.

Our aim is to bridge the innovation-to-application gap by applying Implementation Science (IS) principles, making AI and DT tools more context-sensitive, equitable, and clinically adoptable.

#Barrier-Clusters-Identified

Through the Concept Mapping and Knowledge-to-Action exercise, stakeholders co-identified 96 statements that were organized into the following 11 clusters of barriers to AI adoption in diagnostic decision support:

Infrastructure and Integration Barriers:

Limited hardware/software resources, interoperability issues, and lack of infrastructure to support AI systems.

Clinical Skepticism and Loss of Human-Centered Decision-Making:

Concerns that AI may replace or diminish the clinician’s role in patient care.

Insufficient Adaptability to Clinical Complexity:

AI systems often fail to adjust to diverse workflows, rare cases, or atypical patient presentations.

Trust and Accountability Issues in AI-Generated Reporting:

Uncertainty regarding the reliability, traceability, and transparency of AI-driven reports.

Ethical, Legal, Financial, and Privacy Concerns:

Issues surrounding patient data security, legal liabilities, cost-effectiveness, and ethical implications.

Lack of Training and Familiarity with AI Tools:

Clinicians and staff often lack formal training, leading to discomfort or resistance in using AI.

Workflow Disruption and Lack of Standardization:

Integration challenges where AI disrupts established diagnostic routines without standardized guidelines.

Workforce Resistance Due to Job Security Concerns:

Fears that AI adoption may lead to reduced autonomy, professional devaluation, or job displacement.

Limitations of AI in Handling Complex or Atypical Cases:

Doubts about whether AI can manage rare or ambiguous clinical situations requiring expert judgment.

Clinical Distrust and Concerns Over AI Decision-Making:

Lack of confidence in AI’s reasoning processes, particularly when results conflict with clinical intuition.

Bias, Reliability, and Quality Challenges in AI Performance:

Risks of algorithmic bias, inconsistent performance, and reinforcement of health disparities.

Codes/
Contains Python scripts used for data analysis, including multidimensional scaling (MDS), hierarchical clustering, concept mapping, and generation of visual outputs (e.g., cluster maps, similarity matrices).

Figures/
Includes figures prepared for the manuscript and visual summaries of the concept mapping process (e.g., point maps, cluster maps).

Go-Zone Plots/
Stores plots that identify priority actions for implementation by comparing stakeholder ratings (AI users vs. AI developers). These plots highlight statements that are both highly important and highly feasible.

Pattern Match Plots/
Contains visual comparisons of cluster-level ratings between different stakeholder groups (AI users vs. AI developers) across multiple dimensions such as importance, feasibility, and desire to use.

Similarity Matrices/
Holds participant-sorting data transformed into similarity matrices, which serve as the input for multidimensional scaling (MDS) and clustering analyses.
