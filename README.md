## ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**  

This repository contains the **data, analysis scripts, figures, and supplementary materials** from our study on barriers to implementing **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Digital Twins (DTs)** in clinical diagnostic decision support.  

Using **Concept Mapping (CM)** within the **Knowledge-to-Action (KTA)** framework, we engaged diverse stakeholdersâ€”including clinicians, AI developers, health leaders, and implementation expertsâ€”to identify and structure **96 implementation barrier statements** into **11 thematic clusters**.  

Our aim is to **bridge the innovation-to-application gap** by applying **Implementation Science (IS)** principles, making AI and DT tools more **context-sensitive, equitable, and clinically adoptable**.

## ðŸ§© **Barrier Clusters Identified**  

Stakeholders co-identified **96 barrier statements**, organized into **11 clusters** of barriers to AI adoption in diagnostic decision support:  

1. **Infrastructure and Integration Barriers**  
   - Limited hardware/software resources, interoperability issues, and lack of infrastructure to support AI systems.  

2. **Clinical Skepticism & Human-Centered Decision-Making**  
   - Concerns that AI may replace or diminish the clinicianâ€™s role in patient care.  

3. **Insufficient Adaptability to Clinical Complexity**  
   - AI systems often fail to adjust to diverse workflows, rare cases, or atypical patient presentations.  

4. **Trust & Accountability Issues in AI Reporting**  
   - Uncertainty regarding reliability, traceability, and transparency of AI-driven reports.  

5. **Ethical, Legal, Financial, and Privacy Concerns**  
   - Issues surrounding patient data security, legal liabilities, cost-effectiveness, and ethical implications.  

6. **Lack of Training & Familiarity with AI Tools**  
   - Clinicians and staff often lack formal training, leading to discomfort or resistance in using AI.  

7. **Workflow Disruption & Lack of Standardization**  
   - Integration challenges where AI disrupts established diagnostic routines without standardized guidelines.  

8. **Workforce Resistance Due to Job Security Concerns**  
   - Fears that AI adoption may lead to reduced autonomy, professional devaluation, or job displacement.  

9. **Limitations of AI in Handling Complex or Rare Cases**  
   - Doubts about whether AI can manage rare or ambiguous clinical situations requiring expert judgment.  

10. **Clinical Distrust in AI Decision-Making**  
    - Lack of confidence in AIâ€™s reasoning processes, especially when results conflict with clinical intuition.  

11. **Bias, Reliability & Quality Challenges in AI Performance**  
    - Risks of algorithmic bias, inconsistent performance, and reinforcement of health disparities.
